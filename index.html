                <p>Amygdala is a fashion and art magazine that reflects the discordance in both worlds. The goal is to put a spotlight on artists and designers to reveal how their experimental design stimulates the new generation.</p>

                    <span><b>About Adrenaline Junkie and Boring Book</b></span><br><br>
                    Boredom has, ironically, fascinated writers and philosophers for centuries. It’s been called a “bestial and indefinable affliction” by Fyodor Dostoevsky and the “leprosy of the soul” by Jean-Paul Sartre. Martin Heidegger argued that “profound boredom” is a gateway to metaphysics that reveals truths about “being as a whole.” There is little existential or scientific consensus on whether boredom is an inherently human trait or a uniquely modern affliction, and whether embracing this “tame longing” (Arthur Schopenhauer) is psychologically harmful or creatively helpful for the late capitalist subject. What we can agree on, however, is that our widespread desperation to avoid boredom has led to some of the grimmest realities of the 21st century: the toxicity of the “attention economy” and the tyranny of tech that indulges and increases our need to fill moments of inactivity with consumption and entertainment.<br><br>
                    
                    The Russian born, Berlin based photographer Vitali Gelwich is firm in his opinion that a little boredom is good for you. Gelwich has spent the last decade creating evocative fashion images that command attention, but his aptly titled Boring Book, released earlier this month, strays dramatically from the subtly glam and sensual style he is best known for. Unlike his other work, Boring Book celebrates a series of photographs that were created with no client, prompt or performance goals in mind. Its contents were pulled from Gelwich’s personal archive: the byproduct of a snap-happy habit he can’t seem to break. Over three years in the making, Boring Book is a collection of things the photographer found charmingly unremarkable. “I started taking pictures because I wanted to create a library of memories,” Gelwich said. “I wanted to be able to look at them 20 or 30 years from now and remember the people around me, the smell, everything. So this book is a return to my original driving force.”<br><br>
                    
                    Challenging viewers to see beauty in the mundane and intimacy in the banal, Gelwich creates a self-portrait through still lives and snapshots, inviting viewers into the moments and vantage points that brought him pause. The photos capture scenes that range from universally familiar (pizza crusts, hair clips, wet feet on shower tiles), to sexy and salacious (dildos, a “fuck you” tattooed on someone’s butt cheek, unidentified white globs on naked bodies) and deeply personal, revealing past hospital visits, loving portraits of his production team, and obsessions with things like motorcycles and Twinkie packaging. The retrospective of “mostly unseen, uncommissioned and forgotten memories” are, according to publisher Hatje Cantz, “the purest representation of who Gelwich is and how he perceives the world.”<br><br>
                    
                    Boring Book echoes its diaristic visual qualities with an intimate opening text, which touches on Gelwich’s life growing up in the East German superblocks of Fürstenwalde. Gelwich writes about past crushes, working in a supermarket, a brief but “embarrassing” desire to become a DJ, and the 13 years he spent training as a pianist – at his mother’s insistence. “There was no questioning it. I had to play every single day, and I absolutely hated it,” Gelwich said. “There were a lot of tears in that time.” He now attributes much of his success in his field to an industrious work ethic honed at the keyboard as a kid. “My Mom was very Russian about education, very strong and strict. Looking back on it, I realize how key it was in what I am doing today.”

                    <span><b>About The Underwater World and The Planetary Calendar</b></span><br><br>
                    Moncler is a brand that was born in the mountains of Grenoble but that, especially in recent years, has expanded all over the world inspired by different scenarios and cities – but above all in dialogue with a growing number of creatives. One of these is the designer DingYun Zhang, born in China and then moved to London to study at the prestigious Central Saint Martins, launching his eponymous brand in February last year and attracting the attention of the entire world fashion community, including Moncler. During the MONDOGENIUS event, Zhang presented his collaborative collection with Moncler Genius that comes out today, accompanied by a campaign that transports his creations into an underwater world, enhancing the volumes and futuristic constructions similar to those of sea creatures. The collection, although linked to a natural environment unusual for Moncler, explores a very familiar theme for the brand: that of the connection between man and nature in the most extreme scenarios.<br><br>

                    The inspirations for the models in the collection, whose exaggerated volumes are obtained with very light fabrics, range from ice fishing tents, inflatable pools and life jackets but also to the fusion between marine life and the natural growth of coral. The structured and layered design, with functional details such as adjustable knot buttons reminiscent of Chinese tradition, hidden zips and glove cuffs. The collection includes coats, padded vests and jackets with or without hood, in glossy ultra-light nylon with a slightly wrinkled appearance, combined with maxi padded masks, leggings and cycling shorts. The palette is inspired by coral in the depths of the sea and plays with the tones of brown, light green, light gray, sand, blue and with the nuances of the earth with abstract patterns and color-block effects revealed through the holes of the fabrics. He even held his own show at the London Fashion Week, where he surprised viewers with his avant garde oversized silhouettes and quilted jackets and trousers.<br><br>

                    When DINGYUN ZHANG was in his second year of school at Central Saint Martins, he was flown to YEEZY’s headquarters in Calabasas and offered a position on the spot. Given that the Beijing-raised designer’s interest in fashion began in the margins of his schoolbooks, sketching the basketball shoes his parents wouldn’t let him purchase, it’s only fitting that he made his mark at YEEZY in the footwear department. Zhang was the mind behind the popular 700 Wave Runners, among other notable sports and military models. Since graduating from CSM in 2020, his presence as a designer has inflated online, where he posts images of his otherworldly winter wear. Its hyperbolic, cartoonish silhouettes are inspired by the colors and contours of underwater life, and have made significant ripples in the fashion industry with their eye-catching ability and playful take on performancewear. Zhang has yet to officially launch his label – or website, for that matter – but he has already been dubbed a Moncler “Genius.” His squid-like face helmets and reef-reminiscent puffer jackets have been seen on K-Pop “Alpha” and 032c Issue #39 cover star CL, Gigi Hadid, and Kaia Gerber, among others.
